# 📇️ Identification Search

This is a project as part of the course "Human- and Identity-centric Machine Learning" in summer 2023. The goal is to perform an identification search as fast and accurate as possible.

## Structure
The folder `src` contains the implementations of all approaches for the identification search.

## Installation
0. Prequisite: You need a Python 3.10 installation on your Windows machine (e.g. activate a conda environment).
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/christian-maurer/identification-search.git
cd identification-search
```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (in Windows)
```
python -m venv .env
".env/Scripts/activate.bat"
```
3. Install the required Python packages with pip
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a folder `data` that contains your dataset

## Useful commands
- Activate venv environment: ```".env/Scripts/activate.bat"```
- Deactivate venv environment: ```deactivate```
- Install a python package into the activated venv environment: ```pip install xyz```
- Get current file with package requirements: ```pip freeze > requirements.txt```
